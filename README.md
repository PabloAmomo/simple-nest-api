## Description

This repository provides a streamlined scaffolding setup for building APIs using NestJS, integrated with TypeORM for database management and featuring local authentication implemented via Passport. The structure is designed to kickstart development by laying down a foundational framework that adheres to best practices and design patterns for scalable and maintainable code. Ideal for developers looking to rapidly deploy robust APIs with a focus on security and efficiency.
